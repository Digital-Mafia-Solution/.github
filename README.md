## Digital Mafia Solutions

We build and audit digital systems for growing businesses.

Our work focuses on:
- Identifying operational bottlenecks
- Reducing unnecessary complexity
- Designing systems that support execution, not chaos

### How We Work
We do not jump straight into building.

Every engagement starts with a structured audit to:
- Identify what actually needs to be built
- Eliminate wasted effort
- Align execution with business priorities

Execution (websites, automation, integrations) follows only when clarity is established.

### Technical Focus
Our projects typically involve:
- Web applications and business websites
- Workflow automation
- System integration and cleanup
- Practical, maintainable architectures

This profile contains selected work, experiments, and internal tools used during delivery.

Clarity before execution.
